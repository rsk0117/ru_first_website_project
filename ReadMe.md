# The Reformed University First Website Project (2014)

The website was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and fully coded by Sukhyun Kim(myself) in 2014. 

There are two websites in this repository, one is in English, and the other one is in Korean. The Korean website has a slightly different web design, and it is in 'ko' folder. 

Currently, The Reformed University is using different platform and hosting for their website. So, some of the links and calling of some images in the codes in this repository might not work properly as some of them are directly linked to their current website address(sub-domains) and/or from their old FTP server. 

All the contents including the images and writings within the website belongs to The Reformed University. But, the most of the the Korean website's contents were translated by Sukhyun Kim(myself).
